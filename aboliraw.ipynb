    "**Problem Statement :** Gun violence has become a grim reality of life in the United States. According to data from the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of Americans say that they know someone who has been shot, and another 23 percent report that a gun has been used to threaten or intimidate them or a family member. United States ranks higher than many other developed countries when it comes to gun violence. Right from child to adult, every age group is involved in these crimes. Are the lenient laws are responsible for increasing number of gun violence? Is getting gun without a permit adding up to the increased numbers of crime?\n",
    "There are many such questions we would like to find solution on. As this is one of the major factor inhibiting growth of US, we have to think on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some questions we want to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which state has the highest number of gun violence crimes?\n",
    "2. Which age group is vulnerable to participate in this crime?\n",
    "3. How does requiring permits for guns affect gun violence?(general strictness)\n",
    "4. Is the news getting reported from an authentic source?\n",
    "5. Which region of a specific state has the most number of these crimes?\n",
    "6. How many people get injured/killed by this incident?\n",
    "9. Are the incidents reported from authentic sources?\n",
    "10. Does gun laws result in the least amount of violent crime by state?\n",
    "11. How does the total amount of gun laws affect gun violence by state?\n",
    "12. Does adding stricter punishment for gunviolence and illegal gun ownership deter gun violence?\n",
    "13. What specific guns are most responsible for mass shootings\n",
    "14. Does pushing the sale for long gun owner ship from 18 to 21 affect gun violence?\n",
